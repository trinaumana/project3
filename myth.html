		<h3>Eva & Ana</h3>
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		<p>Eva and Ana were experimented on by their father when they were children. From that they developed superpowers. Once a woman with powers, the Sinister Siren, started to harass Santa Monica and the rest of Los Angeles County, Eva and Ana decided to help out the authorities and fight her.</p>
		<h4>Full Story</h4>
		<p>"Eva," a muffled voice spoke, "Eva! Wake up!" The voice grew familiar, and Eva was jolted awake when her body started to rock back and forth.</p><br>
<p>"What do you want? Eva groaned as she smacked her sister's hands off her. The usual look of distaste washed over her sister's face.</p><br>
<p>"We need to get to the bakery, and you reek of BO, and I can tell that you haven't brushed your teeth in a few days. You have fifteen minutes to get ready, or else I'm leaving you and you won't get a paycheck for yet another month," she harangued.</p><br>
<p>"Ana, are you ready to step off your soap box?" Eva cut her off. Ana rolled her eyes and pulled the duvet off her sister's body. "God, I just need three more minutes of comfort!"</p><br>
<p>Before closing the bedroom door, Ana pitied, "your whole life has been comfort. Simply working at the bakery is a comfort. You're twenty-seven, start acting like it." She slammed the door softly, in a way only Ana could. Eva groaned and kicked her legs over the side of her bed and got ready for work. Before stepping into the shower, she lifted her arms and smelled herself. "I don't even smell that bad," she scoffed.</p><br>
<p>The car ride to Ana's Bakery was quiet and uncomfortable. The typical pop music was playing as Ana bopped her head around as she flipped on her turn signal, Eva in the passenger seat with her earbuds in and her head pressed against the window. She exaggerated her breath so that the window became foggy and the world outside the car became a greyish blurr. The drive from their apartment to the bakery should have been quick, but due to the high level of traffic to Santa Monica, it was almost an hour. Eva fell asleep curled up in a ball of blackish-purple hair and blue jeans.</p><br>
<br>
<p>The prick of a needle sent the hairs on Eva's arms standing on edge. The thickness of what was being injected into her caused her arm to grow heavy. She wanted to kick and scream as the pain rolled throughout her body, but she was restrained to the table she was laying on. Needle after needle penetrated her skin and left her in a sweat. Ana lay beside her sister screaming, "you're killing her! Dad, you're killing her!" Her father kept going with the experiments, eventually cutting open her stomach and pulling out the contents of her body.</p>
<br>
<p>"I'm going to make you unstoppable," he cooed as he started to alter his own daughter's body. "You're going to be thanking me one day. You're going to be legendary. <i>I'm</i> going to be legendary," he laughed.</p><br>
<p>"Eva! Wake up!" Ana jolted her awake. Eva's face was wan, her heart racing. "Another nightmare?" her sister asked. Eva had the recurring dreams of what their father had put them through when the girls were younger. Their father was a good man once. He loved their mother, and he loved his work. He loved Josef Mengele the most, though. He had an obsession with researching the experiments he conducted in Auschwitz, and he wanted to recreate and expand them. Their father ended up doing experiments on himself and their mother, trying to make them superhumans. He wanted their children to be genetically superior to everyone on earth. He inserted DNA strands from different animals into their blood, he performed surgeries on his wife; and when they were finally having their twins, he hoped they would inherit traits from the experiments and surgeries. However, they did not. Eva and Ana were born as two regular baby girls with brown hair and olive skin. Their father grew furious, he accused his wife of interfering with his work. He resulted to torturing her and putting her under extreme conditions in order to trigger the DNA strands and neurological capabilities into action. The only thing he ended up doing was killing his wife. With her out of the picture, he started to experiment on his daughters. Miraculously, somehow everything was working on them. He performed countless surgeries on them, particularly spending a lot of time working on Eva. He was able to alter her muscles and bones, she was able to stretch her body as much as she wanted, and she was able to fit into the smallest of spaces. He thought that Eva was superior to Ana, and so he spent most of his time trying to figure out the differences in their genes. Ana was able to pick up the ability to turn invisible, but it took a long time. Their father spent months pulling strands from animals like chameleons and octopuses, trying to give Ana the ability to camouflage into her surroundings. The only power the twins were born with was telepathy, but only between the two. They were able to communicate to each other in their heads, without opening their mouths once. Their father also blessed them (that's the term he would use) with great physical strength and agility. He thought they should have been grateful for the powers he gave them. He beat them every time they cried over the things he was doing to them. He was too far out of his mind to understand what he was doing.</p><br>
<p>The experiments would have continued if it weren't for their father being found guilty of murder, malpractice, human experimentation, and child abuse. He was taken away to prison, and the girls were sent to live with their grandparents, but they were scared of them and never showcased any true signs of affections. They ordered the girls to never use their powers. Since then, not a single soul knew of their capabilities.</p><br>
<p>Eva snapped out of her flashback, "but my nightmares will never go away. I'm permanently haunted by him. God, if they had only tracked him down! They could have done something to stop him!" Their father had escaped from prison, and he was never found. No one had ever made any solid attempts at finding him.</p><br>
<p>Ana simply let the conversation fade, she hated bringing up their past. Before Eva knew it, she was sitting alone in the bakery's parking lot. Ana was already opening up shop and preparing for a day's work. Eva's nose was met with the smell of baking bread and pastries when she opened up the front door. "Gosh, you were in the car with me and somehow you still manage to be late!"</p><br>
<p>"By what? Two minutes?" Eva snapped.</p><br>
<p>"You were in the car for fifteen minutes. Look at the time, it's five thirty-nine," Ana nagged. "Come on, start making some rolls."</p><br>
<p>The twins worked mutely for what seemed like ages. By the time Eva asked her sister if she could take a break, it was eight o'clock. And Ana demanded she continued for a while longer. They silently kneaded bread and made pastries, only the faint sound of news coming from the TV plastered to the wall by the tables broke the awkward silence. Without a moment's notice, the anchormen on the TV started frantically speaking of a major event happening. Ana stopped kneading dough as she ran to the TV to turn it up. Eva sat on the counter and pulled her feet up to hop over, "what's going on?"</p><br>
<p>"Shh!" Ana hushed, "and get off! That's a health violation!" Rolling her eyes, Eva jumped off the counter and strolled over to where her sister was standing. The men on TV were rambling on about robberies that were occurring, footage of a woman flying around dropping what seemed to be bombs on banks and stealing money. It was peculiar. The money seemed to just float out of the buildings and come straight to her. Eva and Ana were dumb stricken, gawking at what they were watching on the screen. The news seemed to go on and on. Bank after bank being robbed by this super human who was undefeatable. Ana and Eva kept glancing at each other. For the first time in over a decade, Ana heard Eva's voice in her mind <i>guess we aren't the only mutants, ehh?</i></p><br>
<p>"Don't do that! Eva! Stop! Ugh!" Ana jumped back. There was a weird sensation that washed over her whenever her sister entered her mind. It was as if her body wasn't her own anymore. Eva snickered at her sister's reaction. "It's not funny! We shouldn't be doing that anyway," Ana scolded.</p><br>
<p>"Why? If that lady can pull off something like that, we can, too," Eva said. She stretched out her arm towards the kitchen. "I haven't done that in a while, it feels kinda nice, ya know? It's like stretching, or going to the chiropractor! Yeah, like that. I can rob a bank. Ha! I can rob a bank from a mile away. All I need to do is get my hand in there and the money's mine!" Ana was trying to decipher whether or not her sister was fronting. "I'm just joking," Eva sensed her sister's uneasiness, "but that sucks for those guys, though. They have no chance at getting her into custody."</p><br>
<p>A light bulb went off in Ana's mind, "actually. I think they do. She seems to have powers, right? We have powers, we could maybe help out..."</p><br>
<p>"No, ew. Do you hear yourself?" Eva snorted with laughter. "You just got mad at me for doing the mind thing, and now you're all <i>'let's save the world!'</i>? Oh, come on. Give me a break."</p><br>
<p>Ana restrained herself from getting defensive. Her sister was right. How could Ana believe that they could possibly do anything extreme like that? Ana tapped her fingers on the table beside her and a few pastry crumbs got under her nails. "Eva, clean the tables. I'm gonna get back to the kitchen," she ordered.</p><br>
<p>The day went by slowly. Ana had hoped it was just a groggy Wednesday, but the whole week had been dry. When Ana left for lunch, the typically bustling promenade was quiet. The restaurants and cafes were scarcely scattered with one or two people. The world seemed to have been abandoned due to the fear caused by the bank robberies. The woman had robbed ten banks within five days. She also killed six civilians, and it seemed like she was doing everything for her own entertainment. The police were scrambling for any insight on who she was and how to stop her. During her lunch break a week after the problems with the mysterious woman, whom the media had labeled as the Sinister Siren, Ana picked up a newspaper and her eyes were met with an ad that read:</p><br>
<p style="text-align: center">$25,000 REWARD FOR <br>
CAPTURING THE SINISTER SIREN.<br>
WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE.</p><br>
<p>Running back to the bakery, Ana slammed the ad on the table in front of her sister. Her mouth filled with a blueberry muffin, Eva mumbled inaudibly, "rude much?"</p><br>
<p>"Just read it. That money is ours," Ana smiled and brushed a few strands of hair behind her ear. They immediately both thought of fixing up the bakery and expanding their business.</p><br>
<p>The two girls were spending all of their time in the police station. They were showcasing all their powers and the authorities were making sure they had full control and didn't have anything wrong with themselves. <i>I guess they think we may be radioactive or something? Like, we have kryptonite in us or something. Hah. This isn't Superman, they're so dumb for cops, aren't they?</i> Eva told Ana telepathically. Ana started to laugh, realizing the gift wasn't all that bad. A few police officers in gas masks told the twins how they can only communicate with each other verbally in the presence of authority. "How are we supposed to know this isn't all an act? What if you're working with the Siren?" they argued.</p><br>
<p>"Oh, trust me. I think the Siren has way more than $25,000. Why wouldn't I just join up with her?" Eva joked. "Oh, sorry," she bit her lips regretfully when the cops had questioned her whether or not she was planning on teaming up with her in reality.</p><br>
<p>The girls were ordered to practice their powers whenever they were alone, safe in their apartment. They both had a blast sneaking up on one another, trying to see who was progressing the fastest. By around the third week, Eva had gotten control of her stretching abilities, she just needed to hone her strengths. Ana, however, was having horrible luck. She could only every turn one portion of herself completely invisible at a time. Whether that be her stomach, head, or right leg. She was growing hopeless when finally after a few more weeks, without even realizing, she had camouflaged her entire body and snuck up on Eva, trying to wake her up for work in the morning.</p><br>
<p>Back at the police station, all the authorities were stepping in: FBI, Homeland Security, and the works. They started to teach the girls how to use guns, knives, and they were focusing in on their fighting skills. Eva had taken self defense classes during her freshman year of college, but now they were both learning mixes of judo and taekwondo. Before they knew it, they were able to do anything they pleased. The girls were put to the test when asked to stop a simulation robbery, and they succeeded.</p><br>
<p>"Oh! We've got this is the bag, sis!" Eva squealed. "That Siren won't know what hit her! We're gonna be rich!"</p><br>
<p>Their high hopes were put to the test when the Sinister Siren was back in action. While at the bakery, the girls received a call from the sheriff. The Siren had taken control of a bus full of citizens, and ordered a few criminals to hold them hostage and eventually kill all the people on the bus. She wanted to test the twins to see if she had to worry about them getting in between her and her plans.</p><br>
<p>Quickly, the girls bolted to the scene and were on the chase of the bus. Using her invisibility, Ana ran in front of the bus, stopping it using only her physical strength. Eva crashed in, kicking the door down. The criminals on board quickly jumped at the chance to attack, but using her stretching abilities, Eva quickly entangled the men in her arms, knotting them all up together. "That was a piece of cake!" Eva laughed, "ya know, I kinda like this."</p><br>
<p>The Siren had been watching the girls and how easily they had spoiled her plans. She realized she was going to need to pull off a lot more in order to stop the twins.</p><br>
<p>The next day, multiple problems were occurring, and it was all part of the Siren's plan to get rid of the girls. It was a deadly obstacle course that was spread throughout Los Angeles County. The authorities were scrambling for resolving all the problems. Bridges were collapsing; fire hydrants were exploding and transforming streets into rivers; banks and businesses were being robbed; people were being held hostage. She was moving swiftly through the county, and she was gaining help from typical street criminals. It was a mess. Eva and Ana quickly closed up their bakery. "Ya know, we should go back home and change into something more comfortable," Ana rambled as she sped down the streets of Santa Monica. "We should invest in costumes."</p><br>
<p>"Are you serious? What? You want to wear a cape or something? Change into a catsuit?" Eva mocked.</p><br>
<p>"<i>Actually,</i> that sounds pretty fun," Ana retorted. Eva burst out in laughter. "Okay, okay. Never mind about that. But it'd be nice to change into, like, leggings or something."</p><br>
<p>"Just shut up and drive." Eva tried her best to stop from laughing. They sped onto the freeway and headed towards the collapsing bridges. They swerved in and out of traffic, civilians honking and screaming at them to slow down. At one point, a police officer turned on their lights and tried to pull them over. "God, they're trying to pull us over and we're trying to save their butt. We deserve better than this," Eva waved her face out the window and screamed at the cop car. Once they hit downtown LA, they were faced with collapsed overpasses. More and more were starting to collapse, the Siren was using some of her powers to demolish them. The twins had no knowledge on any of her other powers besides electronegativity and the ability to fly. But apparently she could also send fire flying from her palms, melting metals in an instant. The twins saw the Siren throwing fire balls at an overpass, Eva quickly jumped out of the car and used her elasticity and strength to hold the overpass up as the Siren flew away laughing hysterically, "good luck getting to the Vincent Thomas bridge in time!"</p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Vincent_Thomas_Bridge_2.jpg" height="200" width="330"/></div>
<p>Eva quickly set the piece of concrete and steel that once was called a road on the ground and demanded Ava to give her the keys to their car.</p><br>
<p>"But, Eva, you don't drive," Ana said.</p><br>
<p>"I can pollute the world a little bit just this once," Eva reassured. Eva only over rode a bike. She swore to never get in the driver's seat of a car in her life due to the damage cars did to the earth. Ana had to chauffeur her sister around whenever she had to travel outside the Santa Monica and Venice city limits.</p><br>
<p>"No, no. You seriously don't know how to drive. You're gonna crash," Ana pleaded.</p><br>
<p>"Oh, trust me. I can handle anything. Stop trying to save me. I don't need you. Besides, you need to take care of the hostage situations and robberies. You can't take on the Siren like I can," Eva boiled over. "God, you're always treating me like I'm your little sister who you need to baby all the time. I'm not! I can take care of myself. I don't need you the way you think I do."</p><br>
<p>Instead of arguing, Ana simply bit her tongue and tossed her sister her Volkswagen Bug keys, "just be gentle. She can't take potholes very well." Eva rolled her eyes and drove off.</p><br>
<p>While Ana was taking care of the robberies and hostages, Eva was trying very hard to drive in one single lane. She was speeding down the freeway, her heart racing just a little bit. <i>Hey, Ana, how ya doing?</i> Eva thought to her sister, <i>Long time, no see.</i></p><br>
<p><i>I'm doing well. Only two more banks to save. It's surprisingly easy? But, ugh, just save the bridge. I'll try to get there soon to help, too.</i> Ana responded.</p><br>
<p>Eva didn't allow Ana to hear her think <i>as if I even need you.</i> She sped up and before she knew it, she was at the bridge. The Siren had set up fire barricades, making sure that the people on the bridge couldn't get off. They were trapped. Easily, Eva stretched over the flames. Eva was met with a figure cloaked in black and crimson red. The Siren greeted Eva as if she was an old friend. "Let me see you. Come close, I won't bite,"s she cooed. Eva was already starting to pull out knives and get the show started. "Don't think that I don't know what you're doing. It's a mother's intuition," the Siren laughed as she grabbed Eva's arm and pulled her close. Eva was confused. "What? You don't remember me? Let me introduce myself, I'm your mother," the Siren whispered in her ear. Eva shook trying to escape her grasp, too many emotions boiling over.</p><br>
<p>"No! My mother's dead! He killed her. He.. my fa.." Eva gasped as her mother finally let her go.</p><br>
<p>"Yes, your father killed me. But he didn't know he was just making me stronger. You see, he made the mistake of giving me the DNA of lizards, starfish, and earthworms. Not the most glamorous, I know. But somehow, miraculously, my death activated those genes and all my powers. And I became stronger. Sweetie, you look so scared. Why?" The Siren tilted her head, resembling a puppy begging for food. Eva was speechless, left in disbelief. "I know how upset you must be. With everything. Your father, your sister, even the authorities. Why are you even working for them? After everything they've put you through?" Eva was going to speak, but her mother kept going, "they did nothing to try to find your father! And so what? You're going to let them benefit from your abilities? I could never. I want to make them pay for what your father did to me. Make them wish they stopped him before he was able to make us so strong. Make them wish they helped us when we needed closure and justice. And, baby, I don't know how you stand working alongside your sister. Always in her shadows, and you have stronger powers than her! Yet you always listen to her. Why?"</p><br>
<p>Eva started to feel anger towards her sister; anger towards the police. "Why am I helping?" she questioned herself.</p>
<p>"Eva, my sweet little Eva. I want you to join me. We need to punish them. Punish everyone. What do you say?" The Siren reached out her hand and Eva took it.</p><br>
<p>Something within Eva wanted to make her sister suffer. She wanted her sister to feel as useful as Eva had felt all her life. <i>Eva! Help! I'm on the other side of the fire, help get me over</i> Ana told Eva using their telepathy. Eva told her mother she'd be back. She jumped over the fire and immediately started to fight her sister. Thrown off guard, Ana was completely under her sister's control. Eva had her sister on the floor, beating her and strangulating her. Eva was going off about how Ana had never cared for her and always treated her as if she was inferior. <i>Eva! I swear! Stop! Why are you doing this? Please.</i> Ana begged. Eva went off on how the Siren was their mother and that they deserved to destroy the world.</p><br>
<p>"What have they done for me? Nothing! I kept trying to get them to open up our father's case, to try to find him, but they wouldn't! They don't deserve my help. And you don't deserve my help. You treat me so poorly, and I'm sick of it," Eva went off. But Ana cut her sister's lecture off short when she tried to get her to see the bright side. Ana just wanted to protect her, she wanted to make sure Eva received the best that she could. The best form of revenge is to fight for the good in the world, to not turn out like those who had wronged you. After their agonizing fight that seemed to carry on, Eva slowly came to her senses, feeling pathetic for thinking she could do such a thing. "I'm sorry. For everything. Let's go kick some butt."</p><br>
<p>So, the twins set aside their differences and joined together once more to defeat their mother. The Siren fought back hard. She tried to scorch the girls with fireballs, but they were too fast. When the Siren realized that she was going to lose, she tried to fly away but using her elasticity, Eva rounded her up and the girls took her into custody.</p><br>
<p>The FBI built a fireproof room that the Siren would never be able to escape from, and Eva and Ana not only received their reward money, but they both became honorary heroes and the police and FBI said that they would surely love to use their help in the long run. The girls finally became happy and they had learned to set aside their differences and recognize each other as equals. Not only did they need to keep up with their bakery, but they needed to keep up with fighting the crime of their city.</p><br>
