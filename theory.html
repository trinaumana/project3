		<h3>Government & Politics</h3>
		<p>The king of Umbawillrebu had restricted power due to the use of an educated administration which led to the most worthy people having the most political power, and therefore a stronger civilization. Our civilization was a <em>constitutional monarchy</em>; in which we had a king, but the power to make and pass legislation was held by his administration. However, the king had no say in electing his administration. The citizens of our civilization voted in whomever they thought had the most knowledge to better their society. Administration members were primarily educators, since they held the most knowledge in our society; but because the people voted, anyone who showed signs of strength had the opportunity to get a seat in the administration. The administration took on both the legislative and executive branches of government. They wrote the laws, and they also passed them. However, the king was allowed to veto the most important bills (e.g. bills on immigration and commerce), and then the administration would either revise to make the bill better or completely scratch it. Also, the king could write bills and laws, but he would need to get administrative approval. The use of a constitutional monarchy in our society made sure to keep the king level-headed and it allowed the Rule of Law to flow. However, in order to make sure the administration didn't gain too much power, the citizens formed committees which had the power to take administration members to court if the citizens felt they were abusing their seat. Although the king had barely any power in creating laws, he was in charge of enforcing them. We got the idea of an administration from ancient India, and we combined it with parliament from Europe to give the administration legislative power. Also, we took the idea of citizens voting members into the administration from Athens and the present-day United States. Anyone born in our civilization is automatically a citizen. If you are an immigrant wanting citizenship, you must take and pass humanities and math classes. However, every seven years citizens must takes tests on our government and a few humanities and math courses to ensure they are up to date with everything in our society. Also, the tests allow everyone to be eligible to participate in events such as voting. Because our society focuses so much on education, we don't want ignorance to seep in and damage our government, so we make sure all of our citizens (since all of our citizens have equal rights, everyone gets to vote for the administration) are knowledgeable on all concepts. Our government prospered because we kept our people intelligent and allowed them to work alongside the king in order to make sure everything was running the way they found necessary.</p>
		<h3>Social & Intellectual</h3>
		<p>Umbawillrebu focuses mainly on education and the king. Education is a high value because we wanted everyone in the civilization to have the chance to be able to participate in government roles, and we don't want ignorance to wash off and damage our society. Since education and knowledge was valued so much, schooling was free and granted to all to create equal opportunity to all citizens to learn and prosper. With the more knowledge a person held, the higher a chance they had to get involved with Umbawillrebu's politics and become an administrator to work with the King since it was preferred to have more intellectual people help lead the civilization. There are two universities in Umbawillrebu. They are not mandatory to attend but highly encouraged, since it is how you can have a say in politics. Umbawillrebu's religion, Samarism, is polytheistic. There is a main god, Samara, and minor gods. People look to Samara to better themselves, while they look to minor gods for specific things such as, crops, water, or health. Samarism does not go hand in hand with education, the religion is more based on living your life to the fullest and courtesy to others. There are no religious leaders in our civilization, the people worship freely although we do have a temple in which all citizens can attend in order to pray or worship in their preferred way. Our religion is based off of buddhism which originated in India. Our religion inspires citizens to be respectful so they can be reincarnated into minor gods or into living things. The courthouse holds collections and copies of the laws and regulations of the society so the citizens have easy access to it. Religious texts and passed down myths will be held in books in the temple next to the courthouse. The educators can spread the messages of these religious texts to the illiterate citizens and anyone willing to gain more knowledge, which is encouraged.</p>
		<h3>Economics</h3>
		<p>In our civilization, the economy plays a very big role. Having a marketplace and lots of farmland, trading to benefit the economy is valued. The farms being at the bottom of the mountains, crops grew on rich soil and freshwater which helped the crops grow and prosper. Since the crops needed to be harvested, people worked on these farms to harvest but there was no forced labor or slavery involved. Once harvested, crops and food would be taken by merchants to the marketplace to trade with other citizens. Although the currency of the civilization is coin based, trading and bartering still occurred within the community between citizens. For example, maybe a small bag of grain could be traded for two apples. This way, not much politics are involved and it creates stronger ties with the citizens. This system is known as bartering and was strongly used in medieval europe after the fall of Rome and the adoption of feudalism. Being that some people are inevitably going to make more money, their taxation is 25% which is the same as a middle class US citizen. For the people who make less money, their taxation is 17%. The reasoning for higher money making people paying more is that they've had a fortunate life and must give back to others to give the same opportunities. This tax money goes to the colleges and schooling since school is free and knowledge and education is our main virtue.</p>
