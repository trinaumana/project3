		<h4>Full Story</h4>
		<p>There once was a beautiful baby girl named Celeste. Her parents cared so greatly for her. They tried their hardest to provide only the best for their little girl; Celeste would wear only the softest of silk, eating only the sweetest of berries. Celeste grew up smiling and laughing. The townspeople always admired how kind and intelligent Celeste was, and they were so proud to have such a fine family to turn to in times of need. Celeste and her parents were always giving whatever they had to anyone who needs it.</p></br>
<p>On the eve of Celeste's sixteenth birthday, her parents had traveled to buy her a goat from a nearby town. All her life, Celeste had wanted her own goat, she wanted to be able to provide for her own family and town. When her parents told her of the news, she was ecstatic. She packed her parents baskets of food and made sure their warmest clothes were prepared for the excursion. Before her parents left they held her in their arms and told her how much she meant to them. "We will never let a thing hurt you. You're our precious little gem." And with that, they said their farewells and were off. "We shall see you tomorrow morning. Stay safe, Celeste!"</p></br>
<p>Tomorrow morning never came for Celeste'ss parents, however. Celeste woke up the next morning expecting to find her parents home and jumping into her arms. Instead, she was left with an empty house. <i>Oh, they have probably gotten sidetracked. They'll be here shortly, of course,</i> she thought to herself. Celeste started to clean the house and she prepared a special lunch for when her parents returned home. Minutes passed, which turned to hours, which turned to days. Celeste's heart had broken. Something had happened to her mother and father, and she didn't know what to think. The whole town was mourning. People stopped by to pay their respects and give a kind word. Nothing could repair the ache in her heart, though. She stayed inside her house, the windows locked shut with the blinds down. The only time she left her house was when she had to go to the marketplace. The smile that had once been always present on her bright face had vanished, and the light within her had gone out. Townspeople tried to coax her out of her grief, but it was no use. She had spiralled down and she was no longer the kind little girl she had been. Her eyes were bloodshot with bags so purple they put violets to shame. When she was out, she no longer had the same skip to her walk, the same sway of her dress, the same bounce to her long black hair. Celeste was so depressed and so desperate to get her parents back, she would do anything. There was one person who knew that.</p></br>
<p>A loud knock at the door awoke Celeste from a tear-filled sleep. She wiped her eyes and dragged her feet towards the door. Her hand lingered on the knob. Before turning it, she closed her eyes and scrunched them up tightly. Tears slid down her face like a gentle stream down a mountain. She opened the door and held her breath.</p></br>
<p>"Hello, my child!" an old woman strut passed Celeste and into the house. Celeste furrowed her brows in confusion and distaste. The nasty woman noticed and grabbed Celeste's chin with one wrinkly hand, "Sweetie, don't give me that look. I'm simply here to help you." Her yellow, jagged claws dug into Celeste'ss skin.</p></br>
<p>Celeste's eyes widened, and, for the first time since her parents disappeared, she resembled the same girl everyone once knew. "Help me? Help me with what?" she muttered. Hearing her own voice startled her, she had been mute for so long.</p></br>
<p>The old woman twirled around and rummaged through the room. "Oh, darling, let's just say a little birdie told me about your predicament." A cold laugh escaped her sagging mouth. "I have a solution, however!" she brightened up.</p></br>
<p>Celeste ran towards her, tripping along the way. "Oh, please!" she cried. She held the hem of the woman's skirt in her hands, rubbing it between her fingers.</p></br>
<p>"It will require you to take an oath. You need to be strong for this. Quite frankly, I'm not sure you have what it takes. You see, your parents raised you weak," the woman croaked.</p></br>
<p>"You're wrong!" Celeste caught her anger before she boiled over. "Please," she murmured, "I will do anything you ask. I am the bravest, smartest person you will find."</p></br>
<p>The old woman stepped away from her, a smirk on her leathery face. "Your parents are fine," Celeste's face beamed, "but they are trapped. However, I know where they are. If you do these two deeds for me, I will return them to you."</p></br>
<p>Celeste's knees buckled as the knowledge of her parent's whereabouts washed over her. "Are you... ? You're not...? You aren't lying? Right?" her tongue grew numb as the words were tumbling out of her mouth.</p></br>
<p>"Why would I, darling? Do you see any reason to assume that?" the old woman cooed. "Now, do you swear to complete these two tasks for me? If you don't complete these three tasks, your life will be whisked away. There will be no deal."</p></br>
<p>"Yes," Celeste said without a moment's hesitation. The woman shook Celeste's hand and there was a certain wave that traveled through her arm and down her body. Once their hands unlocked, Celeste felt a little differently but couldn't quite realize why.</p></br>
<p>The old hag told her the two tasks she had to complete and her heart completely sank. However, the need to see her mother's smile again and to hear her father's laugh again kept her from turning her back on the road ahead. She had to complete the tasks. It was too late to back out now, and there was no room for fear or uncertainty. So, with a deep breath, Celeste set off on her journey.</p></br>
<p>As her mind was drowning in ways to pull the deeds off, her fingers fumbled over the small piece of parchment she had written the tasks on. She pulled the parchment out of her dress pocket and read it over, her heart sinking with every word:</p>
<ol>
<li>Steal the stone from the sacred temple of Samara
<li>Murder the Huragerlian man with the blue eye, bring back his fingers and a lock of hair
</ol>
<p>The temple of Samara was far from the quaint town Celeste had grown in; it required eight nights of travel, and a number of treacherous territories. Celeste was ill prepared for the darkness the world had to offer. Her breath was whisked away when she was met with a rickety three hundred foot wooden bridge. Celeste could not see what lay below due to the pitch black of the immeasurable abyss. But the falling sun terrified her more than the bridge. She did not want to be left alone in the barren forest, but she especially did not want to be left alone anywhere at night. With no one to guide or protect her from the elements or animals, Celeste was a living target. <i>I can do this. I can do anything,</i> she repeated to herself as she tiptoed across the bridge. The moment her foot hit solid ground, she sprinted down the path into the dark woods.</p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://img.clipartfest.com/7f08cc4de387e69e23ff04f21c5c90d5_dark-forest-wallpaper-dark-forest-clipart-backgrounds_1440-900.jpeg" height="200" width="330"/></div>
<p><i>I can't do this. I can't take a life. I can't steal from our lady Samara,</i> Celeste thought to herself. <i>This is not me. My parents wouldn't want this.</i> She started to promise herself that she would find her parents on her own, without the help of the old women, but she was hit with a deadly fact. <i>It's too late. I promised her my life. I'm going to die. I'm either going to become a monster, or I will die.</i> Panic set in. The world started to spin around her as her vision grew blurry. Her stomach was in a gigantic knot and her throat grew tight. Celeste's mind started racing with horrid thoughts. She pictured herself as a filthy monster. She could see the disgust that would appear on her parents faces when they find out what she had done to get them back. Celeste was growing dizzy headed and had to lie down. <i>Just ten minutes until I start again,</i> she thought. Trying to calm herself, she closed her eyes. "Just ten minutes," she mumbled.</p></br>
<p>She awoke the next morning to the sound of sheep. A young merchant girl was riding a cart full of sheep and vegetables. "Oh, excuse me!" Celeste called.</p></br>
<p>The merchant girl halted her cattle and tried to order the sheep to stop crying, "Ah, they ever stop yapping! What is it you want? Do you want to trade?" The girl was taken back by the state of Celeste. Her dress was ripped, her hair was matted up, every inch of her was grimy. "Are you okay?"</p></br>
<p>"Yes! I am fine, but I need to get to the temple of Samara, are you headed that way? If you don't mind, would you be kind enough to allow me to hitch along? I can't offer a lot, but I have a few coins," Celeste smiled.</p></br>
<p>The merchant girl stumbled over her words a little before finally saying, "Sure, hop on."</p></br>
</br>
<p>A few days had passed, and Celeste had finally told the merchant girl of her problems. The merchant girl put an idea into Celeste's head. "Why don't you fake these things?" she asked.</p></br>
<p>"I would! But how do I fake fingers and hair?!" Celeste cried.</p></br>
<p>The merchant girl grew quiet for a second before she grabbed a knife she had in the front of the cart and chopped a piece of her hair off. "There. One down, two to go." She rummaged around the back of the cart and pulled out a bag of old carrots. "You said she was an old lady, correct?" The girl asked. "I don"t think she will be able to tell the difference between fingers and these old things." The carrots were wrinkly and white with mold.</p></br>
<p>"The gem? Where are we getting a gem?" Celeste groaned.</p></br>
<p>The merchant girl let out a sigh. "It was a gift from my mother," she said as she pulled a necklace out from under the collar of her dress, "but you need it more." She hit it against the side of the cart and the bright blue gem fell off the necklace. "Now, I can't take you back, but I know someone who can. My cousin, Stella, she will take you back."</p></br>
<p>"What if she says no?" Celeste asked.</p></br>
<p>"Tell her Luna sent you. She won't be able to say no, I promise," Luna brushed a stray hair behind Celeste's ear. "Good luck. I hope you get your parents back. Now, go!"</p></br>
</br>
<p>Celeste found Stella and before she knew it, she was home. Celeste was so happy when she opened the door to her house, but she was even happier knowing that she would have her parents back soon. However, she had a feeling in the back of her mind that something was going to go wrong. <i>Shh, nothing's going to happen,</i> she tried to convince herself.</p></br>
<p>A knock on the door caused Celeste to jump. She knew exactly who it was.</p></br>
<p>"Hello! So lovely to see you again, child!" The woman made her way into the hall. "Shall we just cut to the chase?" Celeste nodded and handed the woman a box, Her wrinkly fingers opened it with eager anticipation, only to be met with undeniable disappointment. "You foolish, foolish girl!" she screeched. She threw the box to the floor and pinned Celeste to the wall by her throat. "Did you think you could fool me?"</p></br>
<p>"I"m sorry! Please! You must understand! I just want my parents!" she cried. "Please!"</p></br>
<p>"Oh, darling! You were never going to get your parents! They have long been dead!" The woman laughed wickedly, "but don't worry, you were going to join them. I was going to kill you regardless. I just wish you could have given me what I needed! You stupid girl!" The woman's grip on Celeste's throat grew stronger. Celeste managed to kick the woman and she ran out the door.</p></br>
<p>The woman was tight on her tail. Celeste was so caught up with trying to outrun her that she didn't realize she was coming to a dead end. She had ran straight towards a cliff overlooking a stormy grey sea. She was trapped.</p></br>
<p>The woman moved closer and closer to Celeste, stalking her like prey, waiting for the best moment to pounce. However, Celeste had different plans. "I can't allow you to make the mistake of murder," Celeste cried. "I don't want anyone to carry that burden on their shoulders, even someone as wicked as you. I hope somehow you manage to do good in your life." Right as the woman lunged towards her, Celeste took a step back and fell towards the sea. Her eyes shut tightly as she plummeted towards the cement hard ocean.</p></br>
<p>Celeste opened her eyes to darkness. She was unaware of where she was, and her heart started to race with panic. Her eyes started to adjust, and she found that she was in a dimly lit corridor. A set of doors opened and someone was calling her name. Without thinking, her feet started to move and she was greeted to a courtroom filled with gods, including Samara.</p></br>
<p>"We have looked over everything, and we have come to a final conclusion," Samara smiled.</p></br>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm a bit confused," Celeste muttered.</p></br>
<p>"Oh, it's alright, Celeste. This is the Judging. You see, you have died. But you have done so much good in your life, you don't have to worry. We all must thank you for sticking to your morals. Thank you for not stealing from me. I knew you were going to make the right decision. I couldn't be more proud of you. Now, I can't tell you the details of your next life, but it is going to be as nice as you can imagine," Samara radiated beauty and tranquility.</p></br>
<p>"Will I be able to meet my parents? Whoever they may be now, I need to know them. I need them," Celeste let out a cry.</p></br>
<p>Samara frowned, "I'm sorry, but that is out of my power. However, you have demonstrated such strength that, if you wish to take, I may grant you Godship. I am aware of the conditions in which your parents passed away, and the position I am offering you will allow you to look over not only your parents safety, but every traveler's safety at night. Will you take this deal?"</p></br>
<p>Celeste smiled, "Yes. Anything that protects people."</p></br>
<p>And so Celeste became the goddess of the moon and stars. When Stella and Luna died, they became her helpers. Stella allowed the stars to help direct travelers, and Luna allowed the moon to reflect light from the sun. Celeste, whom was so scared to travel alone at night, made sure to let travelers have a peace of mind when wandering overnight. She looked over her parents and made sure nothing bad ever happened to them again.</p>
