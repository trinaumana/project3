		<h3>Tour Our City</h3>
		<p>Our civilization has two main sections: the city-center and the neighborhood, with the river separating the two. The neighborhood is where all the housings are, along with a few primary schools and the farming area. The neighborhood is set up to where the social classes (excluding the king and the administration members) are mixed together. Our society does not push social order in the sense that everything is segregated and some classes have more privileges than others, but in the fact that the higher social classes are looked up upon and they tend to hold more political power due to their intelligence, which we talked about in the political paragraph. The children of our civilization were brought up to strive towards knowing as much as possible, so that's why some of the homes in the neighborhood (typically homes of the professors and educators) also doubled as primary schools. The farms are at the very far end of our civilization, right against the mountains. They're against the mountains so that not only do they have to rely on the irrigation system from the river but when snow melts, the water will run straight to the crops. That would help a little bit in case of a dry river season. Onto the city-center side of Umbawillrebu, we first have the palace. The palace is not only home to the king, but his administrators as well. Before being elected, the administrators would live in the neighborhood, but, as long as they hold a seat in the administration, they live in the palace. The reason why the palace isn't in the neighborhood is to set an authoritative appearance. Although our society focuses on acknowledging the smart, the king still needs to hold a strong mien. Along with the palace, we have a temple and a fountain in honor of our religion. Religion isn't a necessity in our society, but it's encouraged since it pushes kindness and self-love. The fountain has a giant statue of our main goddess, Samara, and her baby in the center. The myth of Samara and her child is the first story in our religion that focuses on kindness. We also have three universities, since education is important to us. Finally, we have the market place which is like a tent with umbrellas in front. We have lots of open space, and that's because our society throws constant festivals and we need lots of space to have people gather.</p>
